### Themes

Discover the use of predefined themes with Hugo and learn to customize the appearance of your site by modifying configuration files and overriding theme files. This section also covers theme management to meet the specific needs of your project.

### Site Generation

Familiarize yourself with the generation of static sites using the `hugo` command. Learn to preview your site in your local browser to ensure everything is in order before deployment. Understand generation options to optimize your workflow.

With these solid basics, you'll be ready to explore more advanced features and create high-quality static sites.
