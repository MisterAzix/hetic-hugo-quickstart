# Chapter 1: Installation

## Objective
The aim of this first chapter is to understand the detailed process of installing Hugo, the static site framework. Once this step is completed, you'll be ready to delve into the intricacies of static site development.

### Installing Hugo

To start with Hugo, follow these installation steps carefully:

1. **Download Hugo:** Visit the official Hugo website at [https://gohugo.io/](https://gohugo.io/) and download the version of Hugo suitable for your operating system.

2. **Installation:** Once the file is downloaded, follow the installation instructions specific to your operating system. For most users, this usually involves extracting the downloaded archive and adding the Hugo executable to the system path.

3. **Verification of Installation:** To ensure that the installation has been successful, open your terminal and enter the command `hugo version`. If Hugo is installed correctly, this command should display the installed version.

With Hugo installed, you'll be ready to explore the basics of Hugo and start creating your first static site.
