## Introduction
[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) is an open-source framework for generating static websites, meaning it facilitates the creation of websites without a database. It directly generates HTML, CSS, and Javascript files that are served to the client.

## Markdown

Hugo uses Markdown to manage content. Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows text to be formatted in a structured manner using simple symbols. This makes it easy to write content without requiring in-depth knowledge of more complex markup languages.

## Customization
It is possible to customize a Hugo site with various themes readily available on the internet. It's also possible to create a custom theme by adhering to the well-defined folder structure of the framework.

## Advantage over a more traditional CMS (e.g., WordPress)
### Architecture and Performance
- Hugo: Uses static files, no database, significantly improving page loading speed.
- WordPress: Dynamic with a database, potentially slower due to database queries.

### Ease of Use:
- Hugo: Command-line interface (CLI) for management, requiring a learning curve for non-technical users.
- WordPress: Graphical interface, making content management easier for non-technical users.

### Security
- Hugo: Fewer potential vulnerabilities due to the absence of a database and the use of static files.
- WordPress: More potential risks due to its dynamic nature, requiring proactive security management.

### Scalability
- Hugo: Excellent for small to medium static websites, less suitable for websites requiring advanced features or complex user management.
- WordPress: Well-suited for a diverse range of websites, from small blogs to large enterprises, due to its dynamic and extensible nature.

## Conclusion
Hugo, as a static website generator, offers a fast and efficient alternative for website creation. Its use of Markdown and flexibility in terms of customization make it a wise choice for delivering content simply and quickly.
